# Staging Interaction

**COLLABORATORS: Rachel Minkowitz, Shai Aarons, Jon Caceres, Ariana Bhigroog, Amando Xu**

In the original stage production of Peter Pan, Tinker Bell was represented by a darting light created by a small handheld mirror off-stage, reflecting a little circle of light from a powerful lamp. Tinkerbell communicates her presence through this light to the other characters. See more info [here](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tinker_Bell). 

There is no actor that plays Tinkerbell--her existence in the play comes from the interactions that the other characters have with her.

For lab this week, we draw on this and other inspirations from theatre to stage interactions with a device where the main mode of display/output for the interactive device you are designing is lighting. You will plot the interaction with a storyboard, and use your computer and a smartphone to experiment with what the interactions will look and feel like. 

_Make sure you read all the instructions and understand the whole of the laboratory activity before starting!_



## Prep

### To start the semester, you will need:
1. Read about Git [here](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-What-is-Git%3F).
2. Set up your own Github "Lab Hub" repository to keep all you work in record by [following these instructions](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Developing-and-Designing-Interactive-Devices/blob/2021Fall/readings/Submitting%20Labs.md).
3. Set up the README.md for your Hub repository (for instance, so that it has your name and points to your own Lab 1) and [learn how to](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/) organize and post links to your submissions on your README.md so we can find them easily.


### For this lab, you will need:
1. Paper
2. Markers/ Pens
3. Scissors
4. Smart Phone -- The main required feature is that the phone needs to have a browser and display a webpage.
5. Computer -- We will use your computer to host a webpage which also features controls.
6. Found objects and materials -- You will have to costume your phone so that it looks like some other devices. These materials can include doll clothes, a paper lantern, a bottle, human clothes, a pillow case, etc. Be creative!

### Deliverables for this lab are: 
1. 7 Storyboards
1. 3 Sketches/photos of costumed devices
1. Any reflections you have on the process
1. Video sketch of 3 prototyped interactions
1. Submit the items above in the lab1 folder of your class [Github page], either as links or uploaded files. Each group member should post their own copy of the work to their own Lab Hub, even if some of the work is the same from each person in the group.

### The Report
This README.md page in your own repository should be edited to include the work you have done (the deliverables mentioned above). Following the format below, you can delete everything but the headers and the sections between the **stars**. Write the answers to the questions under the starred sentences. Include any material that explains what you did in this lab hub folder, and link it in your README.md for the lab.

## Part A. Plan 

To stage an interaction with your interactive device, think about:

_Setting:_ Where is this interaction happening? (e.g., a jungle, the kitchen) When is it happening?

_Players:_ Who is involved in the interaction? Who else is there? If you reflect on the design of current day interactive devices like the Amazon Alexa, it’s clear they didn’t take into account people who had roommates, or the presence of children. Think through all the people who are in the setting.

_Activity:_ What is happening between the actors?

_Goals:_ What are the goals of each player? (e.g., jumping to a tree, opening the fridge). 

The interactive device can be anything *except* a computer, a tablet computer or a smart phone, but the main way it interacts needs to be using light.

\*\***Describe your setting, players, activity and goals here.**\*\*

_Setting:_ The kitchen and any other room a person decides to go into from the kitchen - possibly a bedroom or home office. This device is used while things are cooking or baking in a oven. <br><br>
_Players:_ The user, the oven, the food, potentially other people in the room <br><br>
_Activity:_ Rachel puts her cake in the oven, she starts a timer for 30 minutes and then walks away into another room to do homework. She can monitor the progress of the baking cake by just looking at the display on her mini desktop oven sitting next to her in her room. When the oven timer starts the display is red, when the timer is halfway through the display is yellow and when the cake is officially ready, the display turns green and Rachel knows to head back to the kitchen. The cake is cooked perfectly! <br><br>
_Goals:_ Rachel's goal is to make a perfectly cooked cake - not too raw but not overdone, the goal of the mini oven is to keep track of timing to know when to food is finished cooking/baking without Rachel having to physically move to the oven.

Storyboards are a tool for visually exploring a users interaction with a device. They are a fast and cheap method to understand user flow, and iterate on a design before attempting to build on it. Take some time to read through this explanation of [storyboarding in UX design](https://www.smashingmagazine.com/2017/10/storyboarding-ux-design/). Sketch seven storyboards of the interactions you are planning. **It does not need to be perfect**, but must get across the behavior of the interactive device and the other characters in the scene. 

\*\***Include pictures of your storyboards here**\*\*

![storyboardLab1](https://github.com/RachMink/Interactive-Lab-Hub/assets/82296790/0ec6e1f9-5d0a-43aa-8689-99b8e9281134)

**this storyboard was made using Dall-E and Jon Caceres's amazing Photoshop skills

Present your ideas to the other people in your breakout room (or in small groups). You can just get feedback from one another or you can work together on the other parts of the lab.

\*\***Summarize feedback you got here.**\*\*
- What about making some sort of reminder to go back to the oven if the food needs basting or rotation?
- What happens if you're not paying attention to the screen??
- This would be good for people who are hard of hearing - in case they dont hear timers, it requires very little attention to remember to go back to the oven

## Part B. Act out the Interaction

Try physically acting out the interaction you planned. For now, you can just pretend the device is doing the things you’ve scripted for it. 

\*\***Are there things that seemed better on paper than acted out?**\*\*

- No one really has a wallclock and since wee're using our phones for tinkerbell, watching the time interferes with the color
- Some of us don't set timers on our ovens and rather rely on external timers like a phone timer aka Siri.
- Since the colors only represent an approximation there is no precise indication of how much time is remaining.

\*\***Are there new ideas that occur to you or your collaborators that come up from the acting?**\*\*

- instead of using different colors for different amounts of time remaining, what about using a gradient which can change from a completely solid red window to a completely solid green window where the colors are transitioning from red to green in between - acting more like an ombre progress bar.
- possibly creating a wearable device that can be worn around the house rather than sitting on a desk.

## Part C. Prototype the device

You will be using your smartphone as a stand-in for the device you are prototyping. You will use the browser of your smart phone to act as a “light” and use a remote control interface to remotely change the light on that device. 

Code for the "Tinkerbelle" tool, and instructions for setting up the server and your phone are [here](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/tinkerbelle).

We invented this tool for this lab! 

If you run into technical issues with this tool, you can also use a light switch, dimmer, etc. that you can can manually or remotely control.

\*\***Give us feedback on Tinkerbelle.**\*\*

Overall using Tinkerbelle was pretty smooth. When setting up on a Mac device some of us needed to include `--user` in order for the `requirements.txt` to properly install with Python3. Also, we opted to use local machines rather than virtual ones.


## Part D. Wizard the device
Take a little time to set up the wizarding set-up that allows for someone to remotely control the device while someone acts with it. Hint: You can use Zoom to record videos, and you can pin someone’s video feed if that is the scene which you want to record. 

\*\***Include your first attempts at recording the set-up video here.**\*\*

![zoom2tinkerbelle](https://github.com/RachMink/Interactive-Lab-Hub/assets/82296790/69657b4e-5134-4f0d-bdcc-860a609a6750)
![zoom1tinkerbeller](https://github.com/RachMink/Interactive-Lab-Hub/assets/82296790/8fa7e9ae-a0d4-44ce-951d-e7d48db0e29c)

Yay! Tinkerbeller works properly!

Now, change the goal within the same setting, and update the interaction with the paper prototype. 

\*\***Show the follow-up work here.**\*\*

Our prototype changes color according to how much time is left in the oven - 
- Red means not done
- Yellow means halfway done
- Green means ready to be eaten 

## Part E. Costume the device

Only now should you start worrying about what the device should look like. Develop three costumes so that you can use your phone as this device.

Think about the setting of the device: is the environment a place where the device could overheat? Is water a danger? Does it need to have bright colors in an emergency setting?

\*\***Include sketches of what your devices might look like here.**\*\*

![devices1 2-1](https://github.com/RachMink/Interactive-Lab-Hub/assets/82296790/c8e48d6e-aca1-4054-b483-39e411335845) <br>
![device3-1](https://github.com/RachMink/Interactive-Lab-Hub/assets/82296790/543eed27-8421-43b1-9ae7-d3ca9a21ec87)


\*\***What concerns or opportunitities are influencing the way you've designed the device to look?**\*\*

In our first rendition of the device we thought to create a 'mini desktop oven' that people can look at if they're waiting on something in the oven while working at their desk. This device would be about the size of a tissue box (easily left on a desk) and it's 'window' would be the changing light display. This device is optimal for those that spend lots of time at their desks and want a trendy, functional addition to their desktop setting. Since the setting of a desktop could be both a light and dim setting (when the room light is shut off) the display would react to the external lightsource and brighten/dim accordingly.

While we were sketching out the mini desktop oven the idea that someone might not be tied to their desks came up. So we decided to go with a wearable device as well. Creating a wearable mini oven would allow the user to walk around and travel while they wait on their food. We opted for an inconspicuous looking wristwatch which has oven components and who's face changes colors according to food readiness. This item would allow for a certain amount of flexibility when using and can prove functional to active people who often multitask. 

The third design we went with is by far the most inconspicuous. We were thinking about people who live in small spaces, don't have a desk, or don't have room on their desk for a mini desktop oven. Our third design is a colored light that is integrated into a lamp. As with the other designs - the color of the light changes according to how ready the food is but this time the lamp is not a standalone device and turns into a lamp as long as their is nothing in the oven. This device lends to a clean asthetic, does not create clutter and looks like a regualar lamp when not in use.

## Part F. Record

\*\***Take a video of your prototyped interaction.**\*\*

The group as a whole did a great job collaborating on work and providing feedback in order to iterate through the design process smoothly. 
Thank you to our great film creators - Jon, Adriana, and Shai! 
Thank you Rachel for drawing the prototypes and Amando for making sure everything is inplace. 

Thank you OpenAI for creating Dall-E which we used to create the storyboard (+Jon's Photoshop skills)

# Staging Interaction, Part 2 

This describes the second week's work for this lab activity.


## Prep (to be done before Lab on Wednesday)

You will be assigned three partners from another group. Go to their github pages, view their videos, and provide them with reactions, suggestions & feedback: explain to them what you saw happening in their video. Guess the scene and the goals of the character. Ask them about anything that wasn’t clear. 

\*\***Summarize feedback from your partners here.**\*\*

## Make it your own

Do last week’s assignment again, but this time: 
1) It doesn’t have to (just) use light, 
2) You can use any modality (e.g., vibration, sound) to prototype the behaviors! Again, be creative! Feel free to fork and modify the tinkerbell code! 
3) We will be grading with an emphasis on creativity. 

\*\***Document everything here. (Particularly, we would like to see the storyboard and video, although photos of the prototype are also great.)**\*\*
