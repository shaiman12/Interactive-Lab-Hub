Submitting labs with GitHub: a 3-minute guide
-------------------------------------------------

This guide will walk you through creating a GitHub account, creating your "hub" repository for listing your labs, pulling the lab  and creating new a file for assignments in that homework.

### 1. To create a GitHub account ### 

If you already have a personal GitHub account, feel free to use that -- no need to create a new one for this course. If you don't have an account, create one:

Head over to GitHub.com.
Enter your choice of username, your school email address, and your choice of password.
Click the big green "Sign up for GitHub" button.
If prompted, choose the "free" plan.

### 2. To make your own class "Hub" repository ### 

Visit the [IDD Hub example repository](https://github.com/FAR-Lab/Interactive-Lab-Hub) and "fork" it into your GitHub account by clicking the "fork" link; it should look similar to this:

![Fork repository](fork.png?raw=true)

### 3. To pull lab updates ### 

For each lab, you'll need to make a pull request to get the new lab files into your hub. These are usually ready on Tuesday for the following Thursday.

From *your* Interactive-Lab-Hub, go to "Pull Requests".

<!--![Pull Requests](pull.png?raw=true)-->
![Pull Requests](Instructions2021/1.PullRequests.png?raw=true)

Click on "New Pull Request".

<!--![New Pull Request](Newpull.png?raw=true)-->
![New Pull Request](Instructions2021/2.NewPullRequest.png?raw=true)

Set the base repository to be your own Hub repo, and the head repository to FAR-LAB/Interactive-Lab-Hub. (This is *not* the default)

Click on “Create pull request“. If you cannot see the setting options, click on the "compare across forks".

<!--![Create Pull Request](compare_changes.png?raw=true)-->
![Create Pull Request](Instructions2021/3.PullRequestSetting.png?raw=true)

Give description, e.g. "Updating new lab content".

![Pull Request Description](Instructions2021/4.PullRequestDescription.png?raw=true)

Click on "Merge Pull Request."
![Merge Pull Request](Instructions2021/5.MergePullRequest.png?raw=true)


### 4. To create a new file for an assignment ### 

1.  Click the "Create new file" button on your repository page:
    
    <!--![New File](https://github.com/jdz32/github-guide/blob/master/img/new-file.png?raw=true)-->
    ![New File](Instructions2021/CreateNewFile.png?raw=true)
    
    Note that you can also click the "Upload files" button instead to add images, movies, or other file times to your repository.

2.  Give your new file a sensible name, like "exercise.py". The file extension you choose  (".py" here) should match
    the programming language used in the file; for Python script use ".py"; for Javascript use ".js"; for Processing, use ".pde"; for Arduino, use ".ino".
    
    Then, paste your code into the "Edit new file" tab.
    
    Finally, click the "Commit new file" button.
    
    <!--![New file options](https://github.com/jdz32/github-guide/blob/master/img/new-file-entry.png?raw=true)-->

3.  To edit the main repository `README.md` file, or if you later wish to 
    make changes to your code, you can do so through github as well. First,
    find the file you'd like to change, and click on the file name:
    
    <!--![File list](https://github.com/jdz32/github-guide/blob/master/img/file-list.png?raw=true)-->
    ![File list](Instructions2021/ClickonFileName.png?raw=true)
    
    Then, click the "Edit this file" icon:
    
    <!--![Edit file](https://github.com/jdz32/github-guide/blob/master/img//edit-file.png?raw=true)-->
    ![Edit file](Instructions2021/EditThisFile.png?raw=true)
    
    Make your changes as in step 2 above.
